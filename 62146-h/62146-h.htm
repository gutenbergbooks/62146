<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I took the two poems from Nathalia&#8217;s mother,
and promised to read them, I had seen none of the press
notices of Miss Crane&#8217;s talent. Being only a quasi-journalist
I seldom read the newspapers. I am extremely
skeptical of infant prodigies, and the poems of Nathalia&#8217;s
that I have since seen most quoted in newspaper articles
about her are just what you would expect. They prove
nothing except that she is a little girl with a lively fancy.
Certain poems in this first collection, however, seem to
me to prove something more.</p>

<p>Some long time ago in Scotland there was a little girl
named Marjorie Fleming, and to-day a twelve-year-old,
Helen Douglas Adam, the daughter of a Scotch parson
and his wife of Dundee, is her successor overseas to the
juvenile purple. Miss Adam has now been published
both in England and America. Yet the best poems of
hers that I have read do not seem to me to possess such
individuality or such maturity of melody and diction as
Miss Crane&#8217;s best poems. Then there is our own Hilda
Conkling, whose mother is a distinguished American poet,
and who writes in free verse and has published several
volumes of poems. Hilda is a real poet. But she has
never grappled with and conquered certain problems of
poetic structure from which Miss Crane, by sheer instinct,
seems to have wrested occasional victory.</p>

<p>I took the two poems from Nathalia&#8217;s mother; and
first I read <i>The Blind Girl</i>. I came upon the two verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In the darkness who would answer for the color of a rose,</div>
<div class="verse">Or the vestments of the May moth and the pilgrimage it goes.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<hr class="tb" />
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh, night, thy soothing prophecies companion all our ways,</div>
<div class="verse">Until releasing hands let fall the catalogue of days.</div>
</div></div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIV" id="Page_XIV">[XIV]</a></span>These lines and the meditation from which they spring
were the spontaneous phrasing and the natural meditation
of&mdash;a child of ten. That in itself, I think, is sufficiently
remarkable.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In the darkness who would cavil at the question of a line,</div>
<div class="verse">Since the darkness holds all loveliness beyond the mere design.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Strange insight for a comparative infant!</p>

<p>In her lighter moments&mdash;and, naturally, there are a
great many&mdash;Nathalia&#8217;s &#8220;heart is all a-flutter like the
washing on the line&#8221;; she &#8220;could not stain romance with
monetary fee&#8221;; and, when she has sat upon a bumble-bee,
she knows &#8220;the tenseness of humiliating pain.&#8221; Many a
grown humorist might envy the freshness of such amusing
phrase.</p>

<p>There is much laughter and nonsense in this book&mdash;that
of a rather romantic little girl with a quick eye and ear
and a pert fancy. But there is, as I have intimated,
more than that.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Cloud-made mountains towered</div>
<div class="indent">Beckoning to me;</div>
<div class="verse">Visionary triremes</div>
<div class="indent">Talked about the sea.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There were strings of camels</div>
<div class="indent">On the Tunis sands.</div>
<div class="verse">There were certain cities</div>
<div class="indent">Holding out their hands.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here the thing we call poetry asserts itself. The instinct
for remarkable phrase and striking figurative expression
is either inborn or it is not. Facility with rhyme and
metre is not nearly so remarkable. But when a child can
write, as in the poem <i>My Husbands</i>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I hear in soft recession</div>
<div class="indent">The praise they give to me;</div>
<div class="verse">I hear them chant my titles</div>
<div class="indent">From all antiquity.</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XV" id="Page_XV">[XV]</a></span>it is almost uncanny. Here is, if you like, a somewhat
derivative diction, but here also is true poetry by every
test.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">He showed me like a master</div>
<div class="indent">That one rose makes a gown:</div>
<div class="verse">That looking up to Heaven</div>
<div class="indent">Is merely looking down.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Well, I not only wonder how she has learned simple
finality of phrase so quickly; I also wonder whether she
can possibly realize the philosophical implications of her
best poems.</p>

<p>As for imagery, Nathalia&#8217;s angels hearing &#8220;the hurdy-gurdies
in the Candle-Maker&#8217;s Row&#8221; is an example of
her fancy that quickens into imagination. She sees the
Oriental bees flying &#8220;in golden convoys to the mountains
of the moon,&#8221; she quizzically presents the pathos of <i>The
Dinosaurs&#8217; Eggs</i>; she has &#8220;steered by stars that sorrowed,
with the moonlight in our wake&#8221;; she sees Berkley
Common</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Like a manuscript, all yellow, and with many things deleted,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet a manuscript completed, with embellishments most rare,</div>
<div class="verse">Berkley Common lies forgotten, with its fields of everlasting,</div>
<div class="verse">And the sunlight on the windows of the empty houses there.</div>
</div></div>

<p>As to exactly what she is trying to say in <i>The
Symbols</i>, I am in doubt, but it is hard to forget the
Talmud stalking like a rabbi in a gown.</p>

<p>On the one hand, with Nathalia, we have simply a
rhyming gift turned to amusing descriptions of certain
fairly ordinary episodes and characteristics of life that
interest every healthily alert young lady. On the other
hand, we have the beginnings of a poet with a true ear
for rhythm, an eye for the color of words, and a fancy
that often rises into the realm of imagination. I only
hope that the young lady will continue to enjoy all the
ordinary incidents of her existence as much as she has
heretofore, and to perfect her technique in her spare
moments. It needs perfecting. It is hardly to be wondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVI" id="Page_XVI">[XVI]</a></span>
at that her work is still in the experimental stage. She
is not yet &#8220;the youngest of the seers,&#8221; nor yet &#8220;released
from fetters of ancestral pose,&#8221; but there is undoubtedly
conquest of poetic beauty &#8220;waiting down the years&#8221; for
her&mdash;&#8220;revisions of the ruby and the rose,&#8221; as she puts
it. Read the first two verses of <i>The Vestal</i> and marvel
that a young lady of Nathalia&#8217;s age should be able to
master without effort such a perfectly Emily Dickinsonian
idiom. This is no copy; it is something that even Emily
Dickinson would not have been at all ashamed to have
written. And that is a good deal to say.</p>

<p>Now as to prophecies, who can make them? Frankly,
I have not the slightest idea how Miss Crane&#8217;s gift may
develop. I only know that she has given signs of astonishing
precocity as a young poet. Her parents have wisdom
and they will see that she is not spoiled. Her gifts will
simply develop according to her experience of literature
and her experience of life. It is a very ticklish thing to
endeavor in any way to direct so young a gift. It will
find by instinct its own nourishment; that is my belief.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, to Nathalia, good luck on the difficult
road!</p>

NATHALIA AT TEN</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Nathalia&#8217;s</span> day is today. All of Time that is past,
from the birth of those odd old folk, the troglodytes,
about which she has ruminated so pleasantly, up to and
through the final scene of the latest Broadway moving
picture is, to her, a harvested crop&mdash;important in its way
but no longer interesting. And as for tomorrow and
the next year, they will have their turn presently. It is
today....</p>

<p>This extract from Nathalia&#8217;s as yet unarticulated philosophy
is offered by way of information for those who
are instinctively inclined to be harsh, on general principles,
with a talent that springs, a little too boldly perhaps,
ahead of its years.</p>

<p>Nathalia had been writing her verse for several months
before Mr. and Mrs. Crane came across it, writing it
without fuss or excitement and storing it in a small and
private album, content apparently with the reward of
whatever pleasure the rereading of it gave her. If she had,
even secretly, any concern with such a vanity as applause,
she certainly did not betray it. And when shortly before
Christmas of 1922, the little girl mailed some of her
poems to a Brooklyn newspaper and received immediate
acknowledgment from the editor, her parents were as much
astonished as, later on, was the editor of a newspaper
when, after having accepted a number of poems signed
Nathalia Crane, the author herself walked into the office
and proved to be a mite of a human being.</p>

<p>I was one of the file of reporters that trailed into
Nathalia&#8217;s home the morning after her first publication,
bent less on nourishing and encouraging a young artist
than on getting a human-interest story. It was a file
that eventually included generous, vociferous, and indiscriminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVIII" id="Page_XVIII">[XVIII]</a></span>
eulogists, a file that threatened to demoralize
or spoil whatever young talents Nathalia had.</p>

<p>Those kind-hearted newspaper folks showered her with
a shocking amount of almost unqualified praise, some of
it accurately placed but most of it merely blank fire. This
would have been very bad for her but for one thing&mdash;Nathalia
never read any of it.</p>

<p>And so, unaffected, she maintained the same tenor of
her young days, playing with her dolls when she pleased
and retiring to her boudoir to make rhythms when she
pleased. She has always written, and still does write, only
when the fancy prompts her.</p>

<p>What Nathalia has written is the kind of thing that
she can write, whatever its merits or demerits. She has
measured it against no other verse, youthful or adult.
The inspiration for most of it comes from books she
has read, which are mainly romantic in character. As
for the rest, it happens that she is an extraordinarily
articulate little girl, and if in some cases the conceits and
fancies which she crystallizes are no rarer than those that,
in all probability, throng the mysterious mind of every
imaginative child, the explanation is simply that she is
able to utter and clarify them, and these other children
are, for the most part, normally unable to do that. That
also they have, in Nathalia&#8217;s case, taken the form of
mature work, as evidenced, in one way, by the fact that
editors published her contributions for several months
before learning that she was so much below the accepted
age for serious consideration, is, I believe, another mark
of her high singularity.</p>

<p>Others, unfortunately, will be less easily satisfied. A
cynicism concerning the future careers of precocious
children is one of the rigid fundamentals of nearly every
mind. It has, no doubt, a valid basis. But, for that
reason, Nathalia&#8217;s future, probably very dark in popular
prospect, threatens to shade her present. That is why I
offered at the outset, as a point of information, the comment
on Nathalia&#8217;s general attitude toward life. Nathalia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIX" id="Page_XIX">[XIX]</a></span>
I am sure, sees no reason why anybody else should read
these poems with an eye any further ahead in time than
this afternoon&#8217;s sunset. She is content to leave the verdict,
so far as posterity is concerned, to her own grandchildren.</p>

<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">Oh!</span> Mistress Margaret Esther Snow,</div>
<div class="indent">She lived way down in Soap Suds Row;</div>
<div class="verse">She came to school in a gingham frock,</div>
<div class="indent">With breakfast stains upon her smock.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh! Mistress Margaret Esther Snow</div>
<div class="indent">Is rather poor as we all know;</div>
<div class="verse">Her socks are a most unusual sight,</div>
<div class="indent">And her shoes are never quite watertight.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She missed her lessons most every day;</div>
<div class="indent">She seemed too sad to want to play;</div>
<div class="verse">So Miss McHugh, our teacher grave,</div>
<div class="indent">Said she was meeker than any slave.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She so admonished poor Mistress Snow,</div>
<div class="indent">That the little girl longed for Soap Suds Row;</div>
<div class="verse">And lastly, the teacher, to make her bright,</div>
<div class="indent">Gave her a piece to learn to recite.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For three whole days we didn&#8217;t know</div>
<div class="indent">The piece she had given to Mistress Snow;</div>
<div class="verse">But on Monday morning Miss McHugh</div>
<div class="indent">Said: &#8220;Margaret will speak for the 2-A-2.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then Mistress Margaret Esther wailed,</div>
<div class="indent">And all of us girls in sympathy paled;</div>
<div class="verse">But all of a sudden she walked right out,</div>
<div class="indent">She tossed her head as she turned about.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She made a most wonderful Grecian bow</div>
<div class="indent">That someone had taught her in Soap Suds Row;</div>
<div class="verse">Her eyes were shining&mdash;she wasn&#8217;t afraid,</div>
<div class="indent">And she spoke &#8220;The Charge of the Light Brigade.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Did she speak that piece? Well, I guess she did.</div>
<div class="indent">&#8217;Twas a fight to a finish&mdash;she took off the lid;</div>
<div class="verse">The up-stairs classes&mdash;they heard her shout,</div>
<div class="indent">And the principal came to see what &#8217;twas about.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But Mistress Margaret&mdash;she never stayed&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">She gave us the whole of &#8220;The Light Brigade.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">You could smell the smoke, you could see each gun;</div>
<div class="indent">You could hear the galloping horses run.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And we sat stunned in the 2-A-2.</div>
<div class="indent">When we saw what Soap Suds Row could do;</div>
<div class="verse">For she told of the battle and everything done,</div>
<div class="indent">With everyone dead and the glory won.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sometimes her voice was like sugar plums,</div>
<div class="indent">And then it shook with the noise of drums;</div>
<div class="verse">And the girls upstairs, they thought &#8217;twas true</div>
<div class="indent">That there was a fight in the 2-A-2.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Well, when it was over, so sweet was her face</div>
<div class="indent">That she seemed as if dressed in velvet and lace;</div>
<div class="verse">And she made that wonderful bow once more,</div>
<div class="indent">Till her rather scant petticoat touched the floor.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">We clapped our hands, and we made them smart,</div>
<div class="indent">And we were happy around the heart,</div>
<div class="verse">For the way that the teachers crowded in</div>
<div class="indent">Added a lot to the lovely din.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Poor Miss McHugh was pleased till she cried,</div>
<div class="indent">While the 2-A-2 just swelled with pride;</div>
<div class="verse">And so excited was Miss McHugh</div>
<div class="indent">That she didn&#8217;t know just the thing to do.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
<div class="verse">But she kissed our beauty of Soap Suds Row,</div>
<div class="indent">Till Margaret&#8217;s face was all aglow;</div>
<div class="verse">She mentioned that Marge was a human lute&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">She was glad that her bread was bearing fruit.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then the principal said in his stately way</div>
<div class="indent">That for 1-3-9 &#8217;twas a very proud day,</div>
<div class="verse">And that close alignment to classroom rules</div>
<div class="indent">Made genius flourish in public schools.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But somehow the girls in the 2-A-2,</div>
<div class="indent">They get things just a bit askew;</div>
<div class="verse">And they surmise that Mistress Snow</div>
<div class="indent">Found most of her genius in Soap Suds Row.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a maze of contributions such as the poetry editor
of a large metropolitan newspaper printing daily two
or three poems receives there came to me unheralded one
morning in the mail a little poem which bore the name
of an author of whom I had never heard&mdash;Nathalia
Crane. It was a whimsical piece of verse such as an
editor rarely receives, a rhythmical, lilting production
that would gladden the heart of any one. It was called
<i>The History of Honey</i>. Needless to say it was accepted
for publication. Subsequently others submitted by
Nathalia Crane also found a place in <i>The Sun</i>.</p>

<p>Then followed some correspondence in regard to
various other poems but a call at the office made by the
author in answer to a letter about the poem <i>The Army
Laundress</i> disclosed to my amazement that the writer was
none other than a little girl&mdash;a shy, unassuming youngster
who was as embarrassed during the interview as I
was myself. For I must admit I was embarrassed&mdash;or
rather taken aback.</p>

<p>My surprise is excusable. So many times I had received
&#8220;poems&#8221; from youngsters who were careful to
give their ages in addition to their names; so often I
had received visits from doting parents or relatives requesting
publication of verses by their children or sisters
or cousins that I had never dreamed any child would
ever submit any work from his or her pen without adding
the words &#8220;Aged &mdash; years.&#8221; But little Nathalia was
the exception&mdash;and there was nothing in her poems that
I received to indicate her age.</p>

<p>The poems bought were accepted on their merits and
on their merits alone, and many a poet of greater years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and of recognized standing would not despise being
known as the author of <i>The Reading Boy</i>, <i>The Three
Cornered Lot</i> and <i>The Commonplace</i>.</p>

<p>Nathalia Crane is a little girl who plays with dolls
and toys and Roger Jones, whom she has glorified in
some of her poems, when she is not busy at a typewriter
giving expression to dreams and visions. She is also an
author of delightful verse who obtained wide recognition
of her work not because it was written by a child but
because it was in itself worth while reading. For this
alone, if for nothing else, she deserves all the success that
is hers, all the laurels with which her friends and readers
are glad to crown her and none more than the writer
of this &#8220;Afterword&#8221; who came to know Nathalia Crane
through her poetry which did not disclose her years.</p>
